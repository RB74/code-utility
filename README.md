### gcd

Calculates the greatest common divisor between two or more numbers/arrays.

The `helperGcdfunction` uses recursion. Base case is when `y` equals `0`. In this case, return `x`. Otherwise, return the GCD of `y` and the remainder of the division `x/y`.

Uses the reduce function from the inbuild module `functools`. Also defines a method `spread` for javascript like spreading of arrays.

```python 
from functools import reduce


def spread(arg):
    ret = []
    for i in arg:
        if isinstance(i, list):
            ret.extend(i)
        else:
            ret.append(i)
    return ret


def gcd(*args):
    numbers = []
    numbers.extend(spread(list(args)))

    def _gcd(x, y):
        return x if not y else gcd(y, x % y)

    return reduce((lambda x, y: _gcd(x, y)), numbers)

```


``` python
gcd(8,36) # 4
```
### lcm 

Returns the least common multiple of two or more numbers.

Use the `greatest common divisor (GCD)` formula and the fact that `lcm(x,y) = x * y / gcd(x,y)` to determine the least common multiple. The GCD formula uses recursion.

```python 
from functools import reduce


def spread(arg):
    ret = []
    for i in arg:
        if isinstance(i, list):
            ret.extend(i)
        else:
            ret.append(i)
    return ret


def lcm(*args):
    numbers = []
    numbers.extend(spread(list(args)))

    def _gcd(x, y):
        return x if not y else gcd(y, x % y)

    def _lcm(x, y):
        return x * y / _gcd(x, y)

    return reduce((lambda x, y: _lcm(x, y)), numbers)

```


``` python
lcm(12, 7) # 84
lcm([1, 3, 4], 5) # 60
```
### spread

Implements javascript's spread syntax as a function. Flattens the list(non-deep) and returns an array.

```python 
def spread(arg):
    ret = []
    for i in arg:
        if isinstance(i, list):
            ret.extend(i)
        else:
            ret.append(i)
    return ret

```


```python
spread([1,2,3,[4,5,6],[7],8,9]) # [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

### once

Ensures a function is called only once.

Utilizing a closure, use a variable flag and set it to true once the function is called
for the first time, preventing it from being called again. Allow the function to be supplied
with an arbitrary number of arguments using the spread/rest (`...`) operator.

```js
const once = fn => {
  let called = false;
  return (...args) => {
    if (!called) {
      fn(...args);
      called = true;
    }
  };
};
```

```js
const startApp = event => {
  // initializes the app
  console.log(event); // access to any arguments supplied
};
document.addEventListener('click', once(startApp)); // only runs `startApp` once upon click
```

    href="https://github.com/Chalarangelo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelos Chalaris</a>. I'm a
  professional software engineer, based in Greece, and 30 seconds of code is a side project I work on in my free time.
  My love for development and learning is what sparkled this idea and I've put a lot of effort into making it the best
  resource I've never had when I started out as a developer.</p>
